Hi, I'm @aib, a fascinated programmer and, more recently, a new media artist. I've somehow retained my interest in programming despite developing software professionally for the past 20+ years.

Here you might find some samples of what I've done, ranging from microcontroller code for an interactive installation to helper code written for a software engineering job turned into a library. I'm afraid there's not much order to it.

I have a tendancy to fix bugs I come across in free software.

My e-mail address is aibok42. Unfortunately, I still use Gmail.
